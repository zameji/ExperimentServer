<p>
Welcome to the experiment!
</p>
<p>
In this experiment, you will be reading English sentences one word at a time while remembering words or images.
</p>
<p>
Before each sentence, you will be shown an image or you'll be able to play an audio clip. <b>Memorize the image or the words.</b>
</p>
<p>
On the next screen, you will see a series of lines. <b>Press the space bar to make the first word show up.</b>
After the first word shows up, press the space bar to see the next word.
Continue pressing the space bar after each word.
</p>
  <p>
   <b>The sentences are not related to each other. They do not form a story or have a set order.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>After each sentence, you will either have a question about that sentence or you will be asked to recall the image/words that directly preceded the sentence.</b>
</p>
<p>
Images and words relate only to the sentence directly following them. Images will not be rotated or turned, but shown exactly as they were before. Words will be spoken in either a male or female voice, this does not matter to your classification.
</p>
<p>
The experiment will start with a few practice questions.
