Thank you for your responses! Now for the fun part.
</p>
<p>
In this experiment, you will be reading English sentences one word at a time.
</p>
<p>
On the next screen, you will see a series of lines. <b>Press the space bar to make the first word show up.</b>
</p>
  <p>
After the first word shows up, press the space bar to see the next word.
</p>
  <p>
Continue pressing the space bar after each word.
</p>
  <p>
   <b>The sentences are not related to each other. They do not form a story or have a set order.</b>
</p>
<p>
Please try to read as normally as possible. There are about 300 sentences, so we expect it will take about an hour. If you need to take a brief break (to drink some water, go to the bathroom, etc.) please do so while you're on a question screen, not in the middle of a sentence! Halfway through the experiment, you'll have the chance to take a longer break.
