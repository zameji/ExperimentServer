You will now start the longest part of this experiment, in which you will be reading English sentences one word at a time.
</p>
<p>
On the next screen, you will see a series of lines. <b>Press the space bar to make the first word show up.</b>
</p>
  <p>
After the first word shows up, press the space bar to see the next word.
</p>
  <p>
Press the space bar after each following word.
</p>
  <p>
  <b>The sentences are not related to each other. They do not form a story or have a set order.</b>
</p>
<p>
Some sentences are followed by a question. Select the BEST answer of the options provided. <b>You will be told if you select the wrong answer.</b> If you select the correct answer, you will continue to the next sentence with no message.
</p>
<p>
Please try to read as normally as possible. We expect this part will take about 45 minutes. If you need to take a brief break (to drink some water, go to the bathroom, etc.) please do so while you're on a question screen, not in the middle of a sentence! When you are done with this section, you'll have the chance to take a longer break.
</p>
<p>
It is important that your computer remains plugged in for the entire experiment and that you close all background programs (Skype, games, email, etc.) You also need a steady internet connection for the duration of the experiment.
</p>
<p>
If you lose connection, shut the browser, or lose power, you will unfortunately not be able to continue the experiment. Please contact us if this happens.
