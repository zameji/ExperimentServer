<h2>Read Stimuli</h2>

<p>In this section, we'll introduce some of the useful services Tatool is offering. Make sure you've finished the section about creating your first Executable (<a ui-sref="doc({page: 'dev-executable-templates.html'})">Create Executable</a>), as we'll continue adding to the existing code.</p>

<hr class="hr-red">

<p>We're now ready to read the stimuli files created in the <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'dev-executable-create-stimuli.html'})">previous section</a> as a first task for our Executable. Tatool offers a  useful service called <b>executableUtils</b> which provides the necessary functionality. As we only want to read the stimuli file (CSV) and all required stimuli (images) once per Session, we're going to add this code into our Executable Service init() method.</p>

<div class="hint">
  <div class="icon red"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x"></i></div> 
  <div class="text">
    <p>Remember that all <b>actions</b> that should be <b>executed only once per Session</b> (e.g., reading a stimuli file into memory), should be placed into the <b>Executable Service init()</b> method.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The init() method for all Executables is run by Tatool at the beginning of every Session, during which the user is shown an animated loading screen. During the loading screen, Tatool can run multiple init() methods from different Executables at once. It can do so by using the concept of <b>JavaScript Promises</b>, which is a method of running code asynchronously. As the name suggests, a Promise object represents a value that may not be available yet, but will be at some point in the future. A Promise can be kept (i.e., <i>resolved</i>) or, for instance in the case of an error, be broken (i.e., <i>rejected</i>). </p>

<p>What does that mean for our task of reading a stimuli file? If we would read our stimuli file synchronously, all other processes would be blocked until the whole file was read and made available in a variable. Instead, calling the read operation asynchronously will return a Promise immediately, but without blocking any other processes. The Promise tells us that the file is being read in the background and we can go on doing other things and check the Promise at a later time for the actual data. At the end of our init() method, we'll return our own Promise in order to notify Tatool that all asynchronous processing is completed once it's actually done.</p> 

<p>Let's take a look at the necessary code to create a Promise, return it and tell Tatool when the Promise has been satisfied (i.e., resolved or rejected). You can now replace your existing init() method on line 6-8 with the following code:</p>

<h4>myExecutable.service.js</h4>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript">MyExecutable.prototype.init = function() {
  var promise = executableUtils.createPromise();
  // read stimuli file and resolve promise after done
  promise.resolve();
  return promise;
};
</code></pre>

<p>On <b>line 2</b>, we use the executableUtils service to create a Promise and store it in a local variable promise. On <b>line 4</b>, we resolve our promise, and on <b>line 5</b> we return the promise. You're right in assuming that this doesn't make much sense right now, as we resolve our promise before we return it. This looks like a normal synchronous process right now. The magic happens now when we add our call to the read function:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript">MyExecutable.prototype.init = function() {
  var promise = executableUtils.createPromise();

  // manually define resource for stimuliFile
  var stimuliFile = {
    project: {
      name: 'myExperiment',
      access: 'public'
    },
    resourceType: 'stimuli',
    resourceName: 'flanker-arrows.csv'
  };

  // manually define path for stimuliPath
  var stimuliPath = {
    project: {
      name: 'myExperiment',
      access: 'public'
    },
    resourceType: 'stimuli'
  };

  // read the stimuliFile and all image stimuli
  // resolve promise when reading successful and reject when an error occurred
  var self = this;
  executableUtils.getCSVResource(stimuliFile, true, stimuliPath).then(
    function(list) {
      self.stimuliList = list;
      promise.resolve();
    }, function(error) {
      promise.reject(error);
    });

  return promise;
};
</code></pre>

<p>On <b>line 5</b>, we define a new Resource and provide all the details needed for Tatool to access our stimuli file. On <b>line 15</b>, we define a new Path and provide the details needed for Tatool to know where to access our image files. At a later stage, we'll extract these two definitions into a Property which makes configuration a lot easier with the Module Editor.</p>

<p>On <b>line 26</b>, we call the getCSVResource method of the executableUtils service and provide the three required parameters, stimuli file (Resource Property), header (true/false) and stimuli path (Path Property). The actual process of reading our stimuli file runs in the background, at the same time as Tatool continues processing all other Executable init() methods. The method getCSVResource() immediately returns a new Promise, but only once the process of retrieving the CSV is completed, one of the two methods provided in the then() method will be executed. We'll get to the content of the then() method in a bit. Hence, due to the  asynchronous processing, we go straight to <b>line 34</b>  where we return our own Promise before any of the code on line 27-32 has been executed. As soon as Tatool has executed all init() methods, it will check each of the return values for Promises that have not yet been satisfied (i.e., resolved or rejected) and waits.</p>

<p>To check when the Promise of our read operation has been resolved or rejected, we call the method then() on the Promise. This method takes two functions as its parameters. The first function is called if the Promise has been successfully resolved. This function will receive the csv data as its only parameter (list on <b>line 27</b>). On the other hand, if Tatool can't find the file or encounters any other problems during the reading process, the second function will be called which will receive the error message as its only parameter (error on <b>line 30</b>). So, all that's left to do is to add our logic to these two functions. In the case of a successful read, we want to store the csv data into the variable stimuliList (<b>line 28</b>) to be used in our Executable object. Now it gets a little tricky: To make sure that this variable is known in the <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/01/what-you-need-to-know-about-javascript-scope/" target="_blank">scope</a> of the Executable object (and not only within the present method), we'll have to use the JavaScript keyword <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this" target="_blank">this</a>. However, we're currently in the context of the Promise and not the Executable object anymore. Therefore, at an earlier point on <b>line 25</b>, we assigned <i>this</i> (which back then pointed to the Executable object) to a new variable called <i>self</i> which now holds a reference to our Executable object that is still valid in a different context - in our case the context of the Promise. 
Having stored the csv data to our Executable object allows us to access the stimuli data in all our other service methods later on.</p> 

<p>As a final step, we're going to call the resolve() method of our own Promise to notify Tatool that we've now finished all background processing (<b>line 29</b>). In the case of an error, we're going to call the reject() method of our own Promise to notify Tatool of the error that has occurred (<b>line 31</b>). This will make sure that you get a useful error message of what went wrong.</p> 

<p>That's it! The method getCSVResource will not only read our csv file, but it will also parse the csv for any stimuli of type <i>image</i> (identified by stimulusValueType = 'image'), and preload the files from the stimuli path you provided. This will make sure that we can access the images from our local cache later on instead of loading them at the time of stimulus display.</p>

<p>As always it makes sense to test your Executable if it still runs through without throwing any errors. Additionally you could output the stimuliList variable to the web console, which will show you that the data has actually been read. Add the following temporary line after <b>line 28</b>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log('stimuliList length: ', self.stimuliList.length);
</code></pre>
<p>This line outputs the current value of the variable self.stimuliList.length. The console.log is a convenient way to see what's currently stored in any variable. Before you run your Executable make sure to enable the web console in your browser. The console is usually part of the web developer tools that can be activated (see <a href="http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers" target="_blank">here</a> on how to enable it in your browser).</p>

<p>Your console output should look similar to this, showing how many lines/stimuli are available in your variable:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">stimuliList length:  30
</code></pre>
