<h2>Community</h2>
<p>The idea behind Tatool is to support the scientific community with an open-source, thus freely available framework for programming and conducting experiments and training studies. The source code of Tatool is available for further development by everyone. We hope that fellow researchers feel encouraged to help improving Tatool by contributing their ideas. </p>

<p>Use our <a href="https://github.com/tatool/tatool-web" target="_blank">Github</a> page to discuss Tatool and programming with Tatool, and to get help from the community by raising issues.</p>
