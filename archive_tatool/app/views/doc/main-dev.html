<h2>Development</h2>

<p>Do you want to learn how to develop <b>your own tasks and modules</b>? You've come to the right place. We'll guide you through the entire process of creating your own Executable. First, familiarise yourself with the terms and concepts Tatool uses. Take a few minutes to read through the <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'start-glossary.html'})">Glossary</a>. Next, have a look at the <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'dev-basics.html'})">Basics</a> to see what skills are required and to learn more about the technologies used by Tatool. Now it gets serious - <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'dev-getting-started.html'})">get started</a> and setup your local Tatool environment. After that, you can go on and write your first own <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'dev-executable.html'})">Executable</a>.</p>

<p>You're fine with using the <b>pre-existing tasks</b> in Tatool's <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'main-lib.html'})">Task Library</a>? Then you don't have to setup or develop anything, simply use the built-in Tatool Module Editor. Take a look at the <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'main-use.html'})">Using Tatool Web</a> section to learn more.</p>
