<h2>Data Export</h2>

<p>Tatool allows you to configure your Module with different types of Exporters suitable for different scenarios. An Exporter extracts the underlying trial data of a Module and creates a CSV file.

<p>A Module can have multiple Exporters defined at the same time but only one of each type. The following Exporters are supported by Tatool:</p>

<ul class="docContentList">
  <li><b>Upload:</b> Automatically exports data and uploads it to the Tatool Server running the Module after every Session.</li>
  <li><b>Download:</b> Allows the user to download all data to his local disk. (Currently not supported with Safari.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="csv">CSV File Structure<span class="pull-right"><a href ng-click="scrollTo('top')"><i class="fa fa-caret-up fa-lg"></i></a></span></h3>

<p>The structure of the CSV file follows always the same structure: every Trial you save in your Executable corresponds to a line, and every property you add to a Trial corresponds to a column in the CSV. The following attributes are added automatically to your Trials and are therefore always the first columns of the export:</p>

<ul class="docContentList">
  <li><b>userCode:</b> The internal unique and anonymised Tatool user code which allows you to identify the Trials of a specific user.</li>
  <li><b>extId:</b> An external identifier that can be provided when users run your experiment from a module URL.</li>
  <li><b>moduleId:</b> The module generating the Trials. Corresponds to the Module Label provided in the Module Editor.</li>
  <li><b>sessionId:</b> The internal Tatool sequence for Sessions which allows you to identify Trials belonging to the same Session.</li>
  <li><b>sessionToken:</b> The internal session token is a unique code assigned at execution time of a new session. When running a module from the URL this token is displayed to the user at the end and serves as proof that the user completed the experiment.</li>
  <li><b>trialId:</b> The internal Tatool sequence for Trials.</li>
  <li><b>executableId:</b> The name of the Executable generating the Trials.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>If an Executable or Handler stores <b>Module Properties</b>, they will be available in the subsequent columns with the prefix <code>module</code>. For example, a Module Property with the name <code>lastValue</code> as part of the Executable <code>digitTask</code> will receive a column header <code>module.digitTask.lastValue</code>.</p>

<p>If an Executable or Handler stores <b>Session Properties</b>, they will be available in the subsequent columns with the prefix <code>session</code>. For example, a Session Property with the name <code>lastValue</code> as part of the Executable <code>digitTask</code> will receive a column header <code>session.digitTask.lastValue</code>.<br>Tatool stores one mandatory session property with the column header <code>session.complete</code> which indicates whether the Session was completed successfully (1, i.e., all trials were executed or the Module was stopped by pressing Escape) or not completed due to an error (0, e.g., termination of a running Session by refreshing the page or closing the browser window/tab).</p>

<p>All the subsequent columns are customised according to the properties you define in your Trial object. The column header naming will be <code>[executableName].[propertyName]</code>. For example an executable property named <code>setSize</code> as part of an Executable <code>digitTask</code> will receive a column header <code>digitTask.setSize</code>.</p>
