<h2>Handlers</h2>

<p>Handlers provide your Modules with reusable functionality. Instead of duplicating the same code in different Executables, you can extract the logic and make it available for multiple Executables, allowing them to share the same state. A simple example is the Handler called <code>trialCountHandler</code>, doing precisely what the name suggests: it counts trials and allows you to display that information on the screen independent of the Executable.</p>

<p>Handlers are attached to an Element in a Module, which makes the shared functionality available for all child elements. Handlers can be added in the Module Editor. Similiar to Executables, Handlers also support custom Properties which allows you to configure specific behaviour from within the Module Editor.</p>
