<h2>Elements</h2>

<p>An Element is used to group your Executables in different ways. For example, lets say you'd like to execute <i>Executable A</i> followed by <i>Executable B</i>. You can use a List Element for this purpose which allows you to execute the containing Executables in sequence. Elements can also be nested allowing you to create complex execution sequences. The number of executions (i.e., iterations) are configured on the level of Elements.</p>

<p>Tatool currently supports the following Elements with its Module Editor:</p>
<ul id="docPageNav">
  <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> <a href ng-click="scrollTo('list')">List Element</a></li>
  <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> <a href ng-click="scrollTo('dual')">Dual Element</a></li>
</ul>

<hr class="hr-red">

<h3 id="list">List Element<span class="pull-right"><a href ng-click="scrollTo('top')"><i class="fa fa-caret-up fa-lg"></i></a></span></h3>

<p>A List Element can contain any number of Elements or Executables that will either be executed sequentially (one after another in the order as they are listed) or in random order for a specified number of times. For example, the Module in the Figure below consists of a ListElement 1 which contains Executable A, Executable B and another ListElement 2 which in turn contains n more Executables. Note that ListElement 1 is set to 3 iterations. Therefore, Tatool would execute the Module in sequential order for three times.</p>

  <i>Example List Element</i>
</p>

<p>The execution sequence of the example above would be as follows:</p>
<p>[ListElement 1: <b>Iteration 1</b>] > Executable A > Executable B > [ListElement 2] > ...
<br>[ListElement 1: <b>Iteration 2</b>] > Executable A > Executable B > [ListElement 2] > ...
<br>[ListElement 1: <b>Iteration 3</b>] > Executable A > Executable B > [ListElement 2] > ...</p>

<p><b>Order:</b> You can configure the order of execution of a List Element. You can either let the List Element execute its child elements in <b>sequential</b> or in <b>random</b> order. In case of random order, the order will be randomised at the beginning of every iteration.</p>

<p><b>Condition:</b> Use the condition value in case you want to enable/disable the execution of specific Elements depending on an input value. You can provide a custom input condition for every Module execution by adding the parameter <code>c</code> and a value to your module URL (e.g. http://host/#/public/moduleId?c=group1) or by using the <code>setSessionCondition</code> method of the <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'ref-service-dbUtils.html'})">dbUtils</a> Utility Service from within your Executables. The condition has to be a string value without special characters or underscores.<br><b>Example:</b> you could provide two groups of participants with the same Module URL but a different <code>c</code> parameter (<i>group1</i>, <i>group2</i>). You want participants in group1 to see a different Instruction than participants in group2. By creating two List Elements and setting the condition to <i>group1</i> for one List Element and <i>group2</i> for the other List Element you can run the same Module but show different content depending on a condition.</p>

<h3 id="dual">Dual Element<span class="pull-right"><a href ng-click="scrollTo('top')"><i class="fa fa-caret-up fa-lg"></i></a></span></h3>

<p>The Dual Element allows you to implement the execution scenario needed for a dual task (e.g., the <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'lib-exp-brown-peterson.html'})">Brown-Peterson task</a> in Tatool's Task Library). As their name implies, dual tasks are combinations of two distinct tasks (e.g., a digit span and a parity judgment task). Instead of having to implement these two tasks within one single Executable (what would make the code unnecessarily complex and difficult to reuse), the Dual Element allows you to easily combine two separate Executables. This involves setting a primary and a secondary Executable/element. The default execution order is primary > secondary > primary. For example, the first execution of the primary element is the presentation of a list of digits to be memorised, followed by one or more executions of a secondary parity judgment task. Afterward, the primary Executable is executed again, prompting the user to recall the digits memorised in the beginning.</p>

<div class="hint">
  <div class="icon red"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x"></i></div> 
  <div class="text">
    <p>In the <b>Editor</b>, add a Dual Element with two Executables as child elements. The Executable added first will be interpreted as the primary element, and the other Executable will be recognised as the secondary element.</p>
  </div>
</div>



<p>The Figure below illustrates the default sequence of events in a Dual Element. The complete DualElement 1 is iterated two times, reflecting two trials. Executable A is selected as primary element (1), and Executable B as secondary element (2). In this Figure, Executable B is executed only once. To execute it multiple times, use a ListElement as secondary element that contains Executable B and is iterated for as many times as you like it to.</p>

<p>
  <img src="../../images/doc/figure-elements-dual.png" class="internal"><br>
  <i>Example Dual Element</i>
</p>

<p>The execution sequence of the example above would be as follows:</p>
<p>[DualElement 1: <b>Iteration 1</b>] > Executable A > Executable B > Executable A
<br>[DualElement 1: <b>Iteration 2</b>] > Executable A > Executable B > Executable A</p>

<p>Some tasks, such as the <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'lib-exp-complex-span.html'})">Complex Span task</a>, require switching multiple times between the primary and the secondary element before executing the final phase of the primary element. Following the example from above, this would mean that each memorandum (i.e., execution of the primary element) is followed by a parity judgment (i.e., execution of the secondary element), and then followed by the next memorandum (i.e., switching back to the primary element again). Only after all memoranda have been presented, the primary element enters the recall phase.</p>

<p>The Dual Element allows for such additional recursion (i.e., switching several times back and forth between the primary and the secondary element) by calling the <code>suspend()</code> method (available in the executableUtils service) instead of the usual <code>stop()</code> method as part of the primary Executable. As long as you call the <code>suspend()</code> method, the Dual Element will execute the secondary element and come back to the primary element. One iteration is finished as soon as you call <code>stop()</code> on the primary element. To see an example for how to implement the <code>suspend()</code> method, have a look at the <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'lib-exp-memory-span.html'})">Memory Span task</a> in Tatool's task library.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> It is possible to use a Dual Element with only a primary and without any secondary element. For example, if you want to use the <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'lib-exp-memory-span.html'})">Memory Span task</a> as a simple instead of a complex span task, select a Dual child element in the Editor, and then add only one Executable (the tatoolMemorySpan) as a child and omit the secondary element. In such a case, Tatool will first execute the selected Executable as primary element, then look for a secondary element which does not exist, and hence, immediately fall back to the primary element execution.</p>

<p><b>Condition:</b> Same usage as described above for List Element.</p>
