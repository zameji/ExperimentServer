<h2>Store Data</h2>

<p>As a final step, we're going to store the responses the user gave to our stimuli. In Tatool, this means to create a Trial and store it to the database, thereby making it available for data export.</p>

<hr class="hr-red">

<p>Before we can store any data, we have to capture the information we want to store. For this purpose, we're going to extend our Controller as follows:</p>

<h4>myExecutable.ctrl.js</h4>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-line="13,19-20"><code class="language-javascript">tatool.controller('myExecutableCtrl', [ '$scope', 'service',
  function ($scope, service) {

    $scope.stimulusService = service.stimulusService;
    $scope.inputService = service.inputService;
    
    $scope.start = function() {
      service.createStimulus();

      service.inputService.show();
      service.inputService.enable();

      service.startTime = service.stimulusService.show();
    };

    $scope.inputAction = function(input, timing, event) {
      service.inputService.disable();
      service.stimulusService.hide();
      service.endTime = timing;
      service.processResponse(input.givenResponse);
    };

  }]);
</code></pre>

<p>First, we want to measure the time it took the user to respond to the stimulus. Therefore, on <b>line 13</b>, we create a variable called <code>startTime</code> on our service object and assign it the return value of the <code>show()</code> method. This will return a timestamp in milliseconds of when the stimulus has been shown. On <b>line 19</b>, we create a matching <code>endTime</code> variable on our service object and assign it the <code>timing</code> variable that is a parameter of the current function. It contains the timestamp in milliseconds of when the user gave an input (i.e., pressed the key or clicked on the button). We'll use the two timestamps later to calculate the most accurate reaction time possible. On <b>line 20</b>, we call a new custom method <i>processResponse()</i> on our service, which we're going to create in a bit. Note that we removed the call to the <code>stopExecution()</code> method, as we'll do this now as part of our <i>processResponse()</i> method.</p>

<p>With this extra logic in place let's move to our Executable service and implement the new method.</p>

<h4>myExecutable.service.js</h4>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-line="1-2,29-33, 35-44"><code class="language-javascript">tatool.factory('myExecutable',['executableUtils', 'stimulusServiceFactory', 'inputServiceFactory', 'dbUtils',
  function (executableUtils, stimulusServiceFactory, inputServiceFactory, dbUtils) {  
    
    var MyExecutable = executableUtils.createExecutable();

    MyExecutable.prototype.init = function() {
      var promise = executableUtils.createPromise();

      this.counter = 0;
      this.stimulusService = stimulusServiceFactory.createService(this.stimuliPath);
      this.inputService = inputServiceFactory.createService(this.stimuliPath);

      var self = this;
      executableUtils.getCSVResource(this.stimuliFile, true, this.stimuliPath).then(
        function(list) {
          self.stimuliList = list;
          promise.resolve();
        }, function(error) {
          promise.reject(error);
        });

      return promise;
    };

    MyExecutable.prototype.createStimulus = function() {
      var stimulus = executableUtils.getNext(this.stimuliList, this.counter);
      this.stimulusService.set(stimulus);
      this.counter++;

      this.trial = {};
      this.trial.stimulusType = stimulus.stimulusType;
      this.trial.stimulusValue = stimulus.stimulusValue;
      this.trial.correctResponse = stimulus.correctResponse;
    };

    MyExecutable.prototype.processResponse = function(response) {
      this.trial.reactionTime = this.endTime - this.startTime; 
      this.trial.givenResponse = response;
      if (this.trial.correctResponse == this.trial.givenResponse) {
        this.trial.score = 1;
      } else {
        this.trial.score = 0;
      }
      dbUtils.saveTrial(this.trial).then(executableUtils.stop);
    };

    return MyExecutable;
  }]);
</code></pre>
 
<p>First of all, we add the service <code>dbUtils</code> as a new dependency on <b>lines 1 and 2</b>. On <b>line 31</b>, we create a new Trial as a simple JavaScript object with the assignment of an empty object <code>{}</code>. This will serve as our container that we can fill with any data we want to store for the current execution. In most cases, you'll probably want to store the three properties defined on <b>lines 32-34</b> that contain the basic stimulus information (which stimulus was presented, its type, and the correct respones to it). We can get all the information from our stimulus object, because that's what we've provided in our stimuliFile.</p>

<p>Next, on <b>line 36</b>, we create a new custom method called <code>processResponse()</code> with one argument <code>response</code>. That's the method we already referred to on line 20 in our Controller above. The controller will call this method after the user has provided a response by clicking the button or pressing the left or right arrow key. On <b>lines 38-44</b>, we add some more data to our Trial object. First, we calculate the time that elapsed between stimulus onset and user feedback and store it as the <code>reactionTime</code>. The response provided by the user is stored as <code>givenResponse</code>. Now that we know both the correct and the given response, we can derive a <code>score</code>. We set the score to 1 if the response was correct, and otherwise we set it to 0. Finally, on <b>line 45</b>, we use the <code>dbUtils</code> service to save our Trial object to the database. The <code>saveTrial</code> object returns a Promise. Therefore, we call the <code>then</code> method to let the Promise know that as soon as it has finished saving the trial, it can call the <code>stop()</code> method provided by the <code>executableUtils</code> to finish the current execution.</p>

<p>We can now execute our Module again and take a look at the export data afterwards to see whether all our data has been saved correctly.</p>
