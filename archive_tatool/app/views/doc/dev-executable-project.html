<h2>Setup Project</h2>

<p>In this section you'll learn how to setup a new Project which comprises your Executables, stimuli files and other files required for your experiments. To complete this part of the tutorial, you first need <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'dev-getting-started.html'})">Tatool running</a> on your machine.</p>

<hr class="hr-red">

<p>Open your local Tatool instance by opening the website (i.e., <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:3000</a>) in your browser. Login with a user that has the 'Admin' role. Once logged in, click on the 'Admin' tab in the top navigation. On the Admin page you can select the 'Projects' tab at the top and add a new Project. Let's keep it simple for now and give the Project the name <b>'myExperiment'</b> of access type <b>'public'</b>, and provide your login email as the owner. Choose any text you like in the description (e.g., 'My first project'). In addition, we'll have to provide more detailed information about our Executable, so we can select it later in the Module Editor. Add the following text in the Executables (JSON) text field and confirm by pressing Ok:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">[{"customType":"myExecutable","description":"Our executable"}]
</code></pre>

<h3>What's Next?<span class="pull-right"><a href ng-click="scrollTo('top')"><i class="fa fa-caret-up fa-lg"></i></a></span></h3>

<p>Now we'll create the basic files needed for our Executable. To proceed, please go to <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'dev-executable-templates.html'})">Create Executable</a>.</p>
