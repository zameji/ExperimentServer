	<h1><i>Days of the week</i> task</h1>
	<h2>Run 1/4</h2>

	<p>Congratulation, you succeded at learning the task.</p>

	<p>Now comes the real task. It will be identical, except that the time to answer
		will be shorter. It might seem very short, but it is usually enough to answer correctly.
		If you concentrate on the task, it should go well.
	</p>

	<p>Everything will be repeated a few times. That's normal, it's to make sure
		what we measure is stable (that's why distractions disturb your results).
		If you make some mistake, don't worry too much but just continue the task on
		a good pace. It doesn't last very long.
