<h1><i>Days of the week</i> task</h1>
<h2>Practice trial</h2>

<p>For the first task, you will see the name of a day of the week written in the
	center of the screen. You will have to decide whether this day is among the
	two upcoming days (future) or the two previous days (past).</p>
<br />

<center>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="padding:10px; background-color:#e7e7e7; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center">Press the <strong>left
					arrow key</strong> with your left index finger<br /><br />
					if the day is in the <strong id="leftA"></strong>.
			</td>
			<td style="vertical-align:middle"><img src="fingers.jpg" height="200"></td>
			<td style="padding:10px; background-color:#e7e7e7; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center">Press the <strong>right
					arrow key</strong> with your right index finger<br /><br />
					if the day is in the <strong id="rightA"></strong>.
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</center>

<p>There are buttons at the bottom of the screen. They are rather a reminder of
	which is left or right. Please respond with your keyboard: with the left or
	right arrow key. Place your left index finger on the left arrow key and your
	right index finger on the right arrow key.</p>

<p>You will first see a countdown and then start with a practice trial. Your answers now won't be recorded.
	Its only purpose is to make sure you know how the task works.</p>



<p class="center">
	<br>Please press the <span class='highlight_red'>right
		arrow key</span> to start a few practice trials.
