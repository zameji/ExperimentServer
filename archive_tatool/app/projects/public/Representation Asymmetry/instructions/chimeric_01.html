<h1><i>Chimeric face</i> task</h1>

<p>Now comes a quite different task. You will see two faces, one above the other.
	Your task is easier than it seems:</p>

<h2>Which face seems happier ?</h2>

<p>We are interested in your gut feelings; try to respond as fast as possible,
	guided by your first impression. You won't be allowed more than 5 seconds,
	but your average decision times should be much shorter!</p>

<p>Even if, physically, there might be no difference in the </i>affective content</i> 
	between the two members of a pair, experience has shown that human observers
	 may well see a difference, sometimes extremely faint, sometimes rather clear</p>

<p>Press the up key on your keyboard if the face above seems happier,
	press the down key if the other one seems happier.
	You can also answer with your mouse by simply clicking on the face of your choice.</p>



<p class="center">
	<br>Please press the <span class='highlight_red'>right
		arrow key</span> to start the task.
