<h1>Instruction</h1>
	
<p>
  After all animals have been shown, the grid will be cleared and all animals that appeared will be available below the grid. <br><span class='highlight_black'>It's your task now to drag and drop the animals to the positions where they appeared before.</span> Think before you move, as you can't change the position of an animal once it's been dropped. As soon as you've dropped the last animal, you'll receive a visual feedback indicating which animals were placed correctly (green) and which animals were placed wrongly (red).
