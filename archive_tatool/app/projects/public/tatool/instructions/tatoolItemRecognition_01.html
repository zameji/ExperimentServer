		How good are you at remembering pictures?<br> <br>
		You'll see a series of pictures that you'll have to study. Afterwards, you'll be shown another series of pictures, for each of which you'll have to decide as quickly and as accurately as possible whether it was presented during the study phase or whether it's a new picture. A cue will signal the start of the recognition phase.
	</p>
	<p>During the recognition phase, please indicate your response by pressing the corresponding key.</p>
	<br>
	<ul>

			picture is <strong>old</strong> (i.e. has been shown during the study phase).
		</li>
		<li>Press the <span class='highlight_red'>right arrow</span> key if the
			picture is <strong>new</strong> (i.e. has not been shown during the study phase).
