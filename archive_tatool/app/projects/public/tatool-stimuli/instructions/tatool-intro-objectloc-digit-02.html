<p>
  After all digits have been shown, the grid will be cleared and all digit words or numbers that appeared before will be available below the grid. <br><span class='highlight_black'>It's your task now to drag and drop the digits to the positions where they appeared before.</span> Think before you move, as you can't change the position of a digit once you've put it into a position. As soon as you've moved the last digit to a position, you'll receive a visual feedback indicating which digits were placed correctly (green) and which digits were placed wrongly (red).
