  After all animals have been shown, the grid will be cleared and all animal pictures or words that appeared before will be available below the grid. <br><span class='highlight_black'>It's your task now to drag and drop the animals to the positions where they appeared before.</span> Think before you move, as you can't change the position of an animal once you've put it into a position. As soon as you've moved the last animal to a position, you'll receive a visual feedback indicating which animals were placed correctly (green) and which animals were placed wrongly (red).
