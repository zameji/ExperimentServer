		How good are you at remembering associations between colors and
		digits?<br> <br> In this task you have to memorize colors of
		digits with different values and update these <strong>color-digit
			associations</strong> correspondingly whenever new information is presented.<br>
		<br> For this purpose, in the <strong>memorization phase</strong>,
		four digits (between 1 and 9) are displayed in different colors (<span
			style="color: #ff0000;">red</span>, <span style="color: #0000ff;">blue</span>,
		<span style="color: #00ff00;">green</span>, and <span
			style="color: #ffa500;">orange</span>). You have to memorize these
		color-digit associations.<br> <br> <strong>Important:</strong>
		In some trials, you'll be asked to recall the correct associations
		immediately after the memorization phase. Therefore, make sure to
		memorize them really well.
