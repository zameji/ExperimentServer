		How good are you at switching between two tasks?<br> <br>
		You'll see objects with different shapes and colors. You have to <strong>classify</strong>
		these objects according to their <strong>shape</strong>
		(round/angular) and their <strong>color</strong> (blue/green). The
		difficulty lies in <strong>only one of the two dimensions
			being relevant</strong> at a time. Which one that is can <strong>randomly
			switch</strong>. Thus, take care whether you're currently being asked for the
		shape or color when responding. A cue at the top of the screen shows
		you which dimension is the relevant one:

				<td style="padding: 10px; text-align: center"><span
					class='highlight_red'>Shape</span> <br> <br> <img
					src="cue_shape.png"><br>Is the object round or angular?</td>
				<td width="25"></td>
				<td style="padding: 10px; text-align: center"><span
					class='highlight_red'>Color</span><br> <br> <img
					src="cue_color.png"><br>Is the object blue or green?</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
