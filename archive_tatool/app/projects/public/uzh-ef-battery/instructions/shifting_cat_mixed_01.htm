		How good are you at switching between two tasks?<br> <br>
		You'll see images of animals and objects that are of a different size
		in the real-world. You have to <strong>classify</strong> these images
		according to their <strong>animacy</strong> (animal/object) and their
		<strong>size</strong> (smaller/larger than a soccer ball). The
		difficulty lies in <strong>only one of the two dimensions
			being relevant</strong> at a time. Which one that is can <strong>randomly
			switch</strong>. Thus, take care whether you're currently being asked for the
		animacy or size when responding. A cue at the top of the screen shows
		you which dimension is the relevant one:

					or an object?</td>
				<td width="25"></td>
				<td style="padding: 10px; text-align: center"><span

					smaller or larger than a soccer ball?</td>
