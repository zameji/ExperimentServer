<h2>Utility Services</h2>

<p>Tatool offers a set of utility services that are useful when you develop your own Executables or Handlers. The utility services offer methods that can be used to access files, prepare stimuli, store trials, and more. You can also create your own services, offering custom reusable code for your Executables or Handlers. Currently, the utility services comprise <code>dbUtils</code>, <code>executableUtils</code>, <code>statusPanelUtils</code>, and <code>timerUtils</code>.</p>

<p>To use any of the utility services, you need to add the respective dependency to your Executable Service. The following code shows you an example that uses the utility service called <code>dbUtils</code> in your Executable Service:</p>

<h4>myExecutable.service.js</h4>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="line-numbers language-javascript">tatool.factory('myExecutable', [ 'executableUtils', 'dbUtils',
  function (executableUtils, dbUtils) {  

    var MyExecutable = executableUtils.createExecutable();

    MyExecutable.prototype.init = function() {
      // we can start using the dbUtils service here
      dbUtils.setSessionProperty(this, 'currentValue', 12);
    };

    // our custom methods go here

    return MyExecutable;
  }]);
</code></pre>
