<h2>Modules</h2>

<p>In Tatool, a Module groups multiple elements so that they can be executed in sequence. For example, a module for an experiment could comprise instructions, a countdown, some practice trials, and, finally, the experimental trials.</p>

<p>On the tab <i>Modules</i>, users can add publicly available modules by clicking on the <i>Add</i> button (see <b>1</b> in the Figure below). Researchers can also decide to make their modules available to a specified sample of users only. In this case, they will invite users to add their module. Users can either <i>Accept</i> the invitation and thereby add the module, or <i>Decline</i> the invitation (<b>2</b>). Once a public module is added or the invitation for a private module is accepted, it'll turn up in <i>My Modules</i> (<b>3</b>), where it can be run by clicking on <i>Start</i>. Depending on the settings the researcher chose for the module, the user can download and/or upload the data. Finally, by clicking on the <i>recycle bin</i> icon, users can delete the module. Note that data that have already been uploaded to Analytics won't be affected by deleting the module.</p>

    <p>Never run an experiment with the same user login on different computers, as this could lead to corrupt data. Make sure to read the section about how to publish your modules on the next page.</p>
