<h2>Display Stimuli</h2>

<p>This section will introduce you to how to display your stimuli on the screen. Tatool provides some helper services that make displaying stimuli easy.</p>

<h3 id="display">Adding Stimulus Display<span class="pull-right"><a href ng-click="scrollTo('top')"><i class="fa fa-caret-up fa-lg"></i></a></span></h3>

<p>It's time we get to edit our Executable template which is represented as an HTML file. So far, our template contains only the mandatory <code>&lt;tatool></code> element. This element represents an angularJS directive, which couples it to specific code in the background. Instead of adding text or image elements with HTML tags, we're going to use another element called <code>&lt;tatool-stimulus></code> which takes care of this.</p>

<h4>myExecutable.html</h4>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-line="2"><code class="language-markup">&lt;tatool>
  &lt;tatool-stimulus id="centeredExecutable" service="stimulusService">&lt;/tatool-stimulus>
&lt;/tatool>
</code></pre>

<p>We add the id attribute with the value <code>centeredExecutable</code> on <b>line 2</b> as a simple way to position the stimulus at the center of the screen. You'll learn a little later how to assign your own id or class and define the necessary CSS for any other positioning, but for now we'll stick to the centered display. We then add an attribute <code>service</code> to our tatool-stimulus element (also on <b>line 2</b>) and provide the custom value <code>stimulusService</code>. This will allow us to create an interface for our Executable service and controller to access the template in the next step.</p>

<p>As of now, the value <code>stimulusService</code> isn't referencing anything. Let's change that by extending our Executable service with the new logic. We'll create a stimulus service and set a stimulus from our stimuli file to be displayed on the screen.</p>

<h4>myExecutable.service.js</h4>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-line="1-2,9,11,25-29"><code class="language-javascript">tatool.factory('myExecutable', [ 'executableUtils', 'stimulusServiceFactory',
  function (executableUtils, stimulusServiceFactory) {  
    
    var MyExecutable = executableUtils.createExecutable();

    MyExecutable.prototype.init = function() {
      var promise = executableUtils.createPromise();

      this.counter = 0;

      this.stimulusService = stimulusServiceFactory.createService(this.stimuliPath);

      var self = this;
      executableUtils.getCSVResource(this.stimuliFile, true, this.stimuliPath).then(
        function(list) {
          self.stimuliList = list;
          promise.resolve();
        }, function(error) {
          promise.reject(error);
        });

      return promise;
    };

    // our custom methods go here
    MyExecutable.prototype.createStimulus = function() {
      var stimulus = executableUtils.getNext(this.stimuliList, this.counter);
      this.stimulusService.set(stimulus);
      this.counter++;
    };

    MyExecutable.prototype.stopExecution = function() {
      executableUtils.stop();
    };

    return MyExecutable;
  }]);
</code></pre>

<p>First, we add a new dependency to the <code>stimulusServiceFactory</code> on <b>lines 1 and 2</b>. A <code>stimulusServiceFactory</code> does precisely what the name suggests: It generates stimulus services, which we'll shortly make use of. Remember that you always need to define a dependency twice, once as a string in the array and once as a parameter in the main function. To navigate through the list of stimuli while we're proceeding through our experiment, we need a counter variable which we define on <b>line 9</b>. To make sure that every Session begins with the first stimulus, we have to always reset it at the beginning of a Session. Remember that the first position of an Array is 0, which is why we set the <code>counter</code> to 0.</p>

<p>Now, on <b>line 11</b> of our <code>init()</code> method, we use the <code>stimulusServiceFactory</code> to create a stimulus service and store it in the variable <code>this.stimulusService</code>. In the section <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'dev-executable-read-stimuli.html'})">Read Stimuli</a> we learned that the JavaScript keyword <code>this</code> is  a pointer to the current object. In this case that means we store the variable <code>stimulusService</code> on the Executable object, resulting in the variable to be known throughout the scope of the Executable object. The method <code>createService()</code> expects one parameter: the stimuli path to locate the underlying stimuli files (e.g., images). We're going to provide our Property <code>stimuliPath</code>, as that's where we stored our image files.</p>

<p>On <b>lines 26-30</b>, we introduce a new custom method called <code>createStimulus()</code>. Within this method (<b>line 27</b>), we call the executableUtils helper method <code>getNext()</code> to retrieve a stimulus at a specific position in a list of stimuli. The method <code>getNext()</code> expects a list of stimuli (i.e., an array such as our <code>stimuliList</code>) as the first parameter, and the index from which to return a stimulus as the second parameter. This is where we need our <code>counter</code> from above. On <b>line 28</b> we set the returned <code>stimulus</code> to our stimulusService. Finally, on <b>line 29</b>, we increment our internal counter by 1 to make sure that we get the next stimuli on the list the next time the <code>createStimulus</code> method gets called.</p>

<p>That's it for the changes needed in our Executable service. We now have created the stimulusService service which we're ultimately going to use in our template, but these two aren't linked yet. That's when our Controller comes into play. The Controller will bridge the gap to make our <code>stimulusService</code> available in the template in form of the variable <code>stimulusService</code>. At the same time, the Controller is the place where we want to initiate the creation of a stimulus and trigger its actual display.</p>

<h4>myExecutable.ctrl.js</h4>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-line="4,7,9,10"><code class="language-javascript">tatool.controller('myExecutableCtrl', [ '$scope', 'service',
  function ($scope, service) {

    $scope.stimulusService = service.stimulusService;
    
    $scope.start = function() {
      service.createStimulus();

      service.stimulusService.show();
      //service.stopExecution();
    }

  }]);
</code></pre>

<p>On <b>line 4</b>, we assign the <code>stimulusService</code> that we created in our Executable service to the $scope variable <code>stimulusService</code>. The <code>stimulusService</code> was the value of the <code>service</code> attribute we provided earlier in the template. Now we bridged the gap and the <code>stimulusService</code> is linked to our template.</p>

<div class="hint">
  <div class="icon red"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x"></i></div> 
  <div class="text">
    <p>All variables/functions assigned to the <b>$scope</b> object will be accessible in the Executable template.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>On <b>line 7</b>, we call our custom method <code>createStimulus()</code> from our Executable service which will take care of setting the current stimulus. The only thing left to do now is to display the stimulus on the screen. We can take care of that by calling the method <code>show()</code> of the <code>stimulusService</code> on <b>line 9</b>.</p>

<p>When you execute your Module after these changes, one stimulus should be displayed at the center of the screen. Note that we commented out the call to our <code>stopExecution()</code> on <b>line 10</b> for now, as otherwise the Executable would finish before you could see anything on the screen. Therefore, the Module will simply stop after displaying the stimulus and wait.</p>

<h3 id="style">Styling Stimulus Display<span class="pull-right"><a href ng-click="scrollTo('top')"><i class="fa fa-caret-up fa-lg"></i></a></span></h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the actual style of your stimulus (e.g., font colour, background colour, border, position) can be changed to your liking with the help of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a>. By default, Tatool will look for a CSS file accompanying your Executable with the naming convention <i>myExecutable.css</i>. Don't worry, if you're happy with the style as it is, you don't have to provide such a file.</p>

<p>Introducing CSS here would go beyond the scope of this documentation, but there are tons of excellent tutorials on the web, for example the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web" target="_blank">interactive course</a> by Codecademy. The Mozilla Developer Network provides a comprehensive <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference" target="_blank">CSS reference</a>. Once you're up to speed with what CSS is and how the syntax works, you can try changing the look of your stimuli. As an example, we'll now add a coloured border around the images presented in our Flanker Task.</p>

<p>Start by creating your CSS file and copy/save it into the Project executables sub-folder of your local Tatool installation (<b>app/projects/public/myExperiment/executables</b>) where you also put your other Executable related files.</p>

<h4>myExecutable.css</h4>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-css">.stimulusImage {
  border: 1px solid #a5a5a5;
}
</code></pre>

<p>We add a simple CSS class to the CSS file and call it <code>stimulusImage</code>. All it takes is to provide one rule on <b>line 2</b> that adds a solid grayish border with a thickness of 1 pixel. Now that we've created our CSS class, it's time to apply it to our Template.</p>

<h4>myExecutable.html</h4>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-line="2"><code class="language-markup">&lt;tatool>
  &lt;tatool-stimulus id="centeredExecutable" service="stimulusService" class="stimulusImage">&lt;/tatool-stimulus>
&lt;/tatool>
</code></pre>

<p>To apply the CSS class, we have to extend the original Template from above by adding the attribute <code>class</code> to our stimulus element and assign it the value of our class <code>stimulusImage</code>. That's it, when you rerun your task, you should now see the new border around the stimulus image.</p>

<div class="hint">
  <div class="icon red"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x"></i></div> 
  <div class="text">
    <p>To change the entire display of an Executable (for example, to change its background color), you can add a CSS class with the same name that you use for the Executable in the <b>Name</b> field in the Editor.</p>
  </div>
</div>
