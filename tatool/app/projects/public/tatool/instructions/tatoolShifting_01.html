		How good are you at switching between two tasks?<br> <br>
		You'll see digits between 1 and 9. You have to <strong>classify</strong>
		these digits according to their <strong>parity</strong> (odd/even) or
		their <strong>magnitude</strong> (less/greater than 5). The difficulty
		lies in <strong>only one of the two dimensions being relevant</strong>
		at a time. Which one that is can <strong>randomly switch</strong>.
		Thus, take care whether you're currently being asked for the parity or
		magnitude when responding. A cue at the top of the screen shows you
		which dimension is the relevant one:
