		This task measures the ability to focus on relevant and to ignore
		irrelevant information. <br> <br> You'll have to count the <strong>number
			of characters</strong> presented and press the corresponding <strong>number
			key</strong> (on the top row of your keyboard). As soon as you pressed a key,
		the next string of characters will be presented. The difficulty is
		that the number of characters being displayed can differ from their
		actual magnitude.
