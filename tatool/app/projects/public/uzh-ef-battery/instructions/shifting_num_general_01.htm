		flexibility.<br> <br> In the first two tasks, you'll have to
		classify objects as quickly and as accurately as possible according to
		specified rules. <br> Next, the two tasks will be combined and
		you'll have to classify the objects according to changing rules.This
		procedure serves to assess your performance in switching between
		tasks. <br> At the end and to measure your increase in accuracy
		and speed, you'll once again complete both tasks separately.
