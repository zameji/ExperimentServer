		How good are you at remembering associations between colors and
		shapes?<br> <br> In this task you have to memorize shapes in
		different colors and update these <strong>color-shape
			associations</strong> correspondingly whenever new information is presented.<br>
		<br> For this purpose, in the <strong>memorization phase</strong>,
		five shapes (circle, triangle, square, diamond, and hexagon) are
		displayed in different colors. You have to memorize these color-shape
		associations.<br> <br> <strong>Important:</strong> In some
		trials, you'll be asked to recall the correct associations immediately
		after the memorization phase. Therefore, make sure to memorize them
		really well.
