	<h1>During this test, you will use the four arrow keys on your keyboard or screen to respond to words or symbols that you are shown.</h1>

	<p>
		  <br> First, we will practice pressing each of the four arrow key options so you are familiar with where each one is located.
	</p>
On the next screen, you will be shown an image of an arrow key that is either red, yellow, green, or blue. Select the matching left, up, down, or right arrow key on your keyboard or screen.
